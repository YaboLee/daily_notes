## How to download multiple large files?

1. Collect all these links. Anyway, use python crawler or existed link files.

2. ```bash
   wget -c -i download_links.txt 
   # -c is for continuiing when breaking unexpectedly; -i is for given link file.
   ```

3. Why don't use python requests.get()?

   requeests will store everything in the memory. When you want to download very big file, like > 1Gb, it seems impossible.

   However, there seems another way to achieve this. requests.get(url, stream=True), which will use iteration rather than put it into the memory.

   **Waiting to be tried**



## tmux is a very useful tool.

When I want to download multiple large files, they will cost me a lot of time with my computer not sleep or connection to my server.

With tmux, it can save the session of the terminal. To be specific, I can close terminal, which connects the server.

```bash
tmux new # get into a new session
Ctrl+b d # detach from a session
tmux ls # list running session
tmux attach-session -t [number of the session] # attach to the running session

tmux new -s [name of session] # create a tag for a new session
tmux a -t [name of session] # attach to a session by the name
```



Additionally, tmux can help me run multiple terminals in one window. Fantastic!!!

```bash
# in a tmux session
Ctrl+b " # split a pane horizontally
Ctrl+b % # split a pane vertically

Ctrl+b [arrow key] # move from pane to pane

*HOLD* Ctrl+b [arrow key] # resize the pane

```

More tricky,

```bash
Ctrl+b c # create a new window in the session
Ctrl+b n # go to the next window
Ctrl+b p # go to the previous window

Ctrl+b [ # copy mode
```
